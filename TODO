Some todo items:

* Similar to the postgresql.conf settings, only show the interesting or changed values of bucardo_config
* Support for other things: Apache, MySQL, etc.
* Better Bucardo support: use all internal Bucardo tables
* Add time-dependent things such as iostat and txns/second, either by sleeping or
  picking up information from a previous run somehow.
* Internationalize things
* Use pg_controldata output
* Display information from the pg_autovacuum table / reloptions column.
